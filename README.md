## Architecture

This app structure is inspired by the blog post ['Bulletproof node.js project architecture'](https://softwareontheroad.com/ideal-nodejs-project-structure?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)

Please read the blog post in order to have a good understanding of the server architecture.

## Setup

We use `node` version `10.15.0`

```
nvm install 10.15.0
```

```
nvm use 10.15.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

## Start

```
npm run start
```

It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
